# IntelligentSearch Documentation

IntelligentSearch is a Python-based algorithm that provides advanced search functionality for B2B (Business-to-Business) platforms. It leverages AI-powered techniques, including sentence embeddings and cosine similarity, to deliver accurate and relevant search results for B2B products. This documentation provides an overview of the task, the algorithm, the model architecture, and instructions for usage.

## Task Overview

The task of the IntelligentSearch algorithm is to enable B2B platforms to improve their search functionality. By leveraging advanced AI algorithms and techniques, it enhances the search experience for users by providing highly relevant search results based on their queries.

## Algorithm Description

The IntelligentSearch algorithm incorporates several components and techniques to achieve its goal:

1. **Preprocessing**: The algorithm performs necessary preprocessing steps on the documents, such as cleaning and tokenization. This ensures consistent and standardized text representation for accurate search results.

2. **Building the Index**: The algorithm builds an index using AI-powered algorithms such as sentence embeddings. It utilizes the SentenceTransformer library to encode the documents into dense vector representations, which capture the semantic meaning of the text.

3. **Search Functionality**: Given a user query, the algorithm encodes the query into a vector representation using the same sentence embedding model. It then calculates the cosine similarity between the query vector and the document vectors in the index. The top-k documents with the highest similarity scores are retrieved as search results.

## Model Architecture

The IntelligentSearch algorithm employs a state-of-the-art sentence embedding model to generate dense representations for both the documents and the query. In this implementation, the XLM-RoBERTa model, specifically the `xlm-roberta-base` variant, is utilized. The model is pre-trained on a large corpus of text data and has demonstrated strong performance in various NLP tasks.

## Usage Instructions

To use the IntelligentSearch algorithm, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed. This includes numpy, scikit-learn, and the SentenceTransformer library. You can install the required packages by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install numpy scikit-learn sentence-transformers
   ```

2. **Instantiate the Algorithm**: Create an instance of the `IntelligentSearch` class by providing the documents to search within. The documents should be a list of strings, where each string represents a document or product description.

3. **Preprocess Documents**: Call the `preprocess_documents()` method to perform any necessary preprocessing on the documents. This step can include lowercasing the text, removing punctuation, or any other relevant preprocessing steps.

4. **Build the Index**: Call the `build_index()` method to build the search index. This step involves encoding the documents using the chosen sentence embedding model and creating an index for efficient search operations.

5. **Perform Search**: Use the `search(query, top_k)` method to perform a search based on a user query. Provide the query as a string, and specify the desired number of top search results to retrieve (default is 5). The method returns a list of the most relevant documents based on the query.

Here's an example code snippet demonstrating the usage of the IntelligentSearch algorithm:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

class IntelligentSearch:
    # Class implementation here...

# Example usage:
documents = [
    # List of product descriptions
]

search_algorithm = IntelligentSearch(documents)
search_algorithm.preprocess_documents()
search_algorithm.build_index()

query = "User query goes here"
search_results = search_algorithm.search(query)

print("Search Results:")
for result in search_results:
    print(result)
```

## Conclusion

IntelligentSearch provides a sophisticated and AI-powered search algorithm for B2B platforms. By leveraging advanced techniques such as sentence embeddings and cosine similarity, it delivers accurate and relevant search results to enhance the user experience. By following the usage instructions and customizing the algorithm for specific requirements, developers can integrate IntelligentSearch into the B2B platform and empower users with efficient and effective search functionality.
